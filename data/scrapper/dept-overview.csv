0,bme,"Department of Biomedical Engineering (BME) has started its journey in 2016 at Jashore University of Science and Technology. We offer Bachelor of Science in Biomedical Engineering in short B.Sc. Eng. (BME) and PhD in BME. Our very first session of undergraduate program was 2016-2017. Biomedical Engineering is a multidisciplinary subject. It is a combined field of advanced medical technologies with the support of electronics, programming, artificial intelligence, biomedical instrumentations, communication protocols, drug delivery, clinical engineering, rehabilitation engineering and medical imaging."

2,cse,"Currently the department has 12 faculty members and 5 staffs. The number of current undergraduate students is 180. In master's level, there are about 80 students in 4 different batches. The department's intake in the undergrad level is 50 per year. The growth of the department is reflected through the creation of a faculty of Computing and Information Engineering within next 3 years. Moreover, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) is going to fund for a BDT 112 Crore project for CSE, JUST in order to enhance the IT education in Bangladesh. Recently the faculty members of CSE, JUST achieved research and development project funds from the Ministry of Science and Technology, GoB (BDT 200K), TEIN*CC (EUR 26,046) and JUST research fund (BDT 195K).."
3,eee,"Electrical engineering permeates every aspect of contemporary civilization, from solar cells and electric vehicles to computers with billions of transistors and microgrids fueled by renewable energy sources. To create ground-breaking sensors and energy transducers, novel physical substrates for computing, and systems that solve the common problems facing mankind, we make use of computational, theoretical, and experimental methods.Our multidisciplinary study affects every aspect of human life, including energy and the environment, human health, communications and technology, finance, and music. We influence the future.Â The expertise of the faculty members of this department covers various fields ranging from power systems to nanotechnology. The research areas of teachers and students of this department include power, energy, electrical machines, solid state device, signals and systems, signal processing, image processing, device modelling, power electronics, control engineering, high voltage engineering, biomedical engineering, microwave engineering, optical fiber communication, mobile telecommunication, device fabrication, VLSI and nanotechnology.The department is committed to the study and analysis of fundamental as well as applied problems. Teachers and students of the department work in solving problems in the fields of conventional and renewable energy generation, transmission and utilization, high voltage transients, power system planning, reliability, operation, control and protection, machine and drives design, microwave fading, microstrip antenna design, remote sensing, design and synthesis of VLSI and ULSI circuits, semiconductor device design and characterization, digital signals and image processing, neural networks and bio-medical signal conditioning and identification of processed signals, mobile telecommunication, and optical fibers etc."
4,ipe,"Industrial and Production Engineering (IPE) is an engineering fraternity that is greatly valued internationally. It started its journey in 2009. Since then it has been providing new knowledge and techniques of industrial as well as production engineering aspects to the students. This department offers diversified field of study and research, which will facilitate the students to become the pioneer of their working areas. Our vibrant undergraduate program provides a broad knowledge of theoretical aspects of different industrial processes, design and implementation. In the meanwhile, the department has organized various seminars, workshops and invited knowledgeable and potential guests from various fields.The department is rich in resources, including library and laboratories, necessary for the development and nourishment of skills for engineers. We earnestly emphasize on a healthy and intimate teacher-student relationship so that the true potential of each student is realized and flourished."
5,pme,"At the verge of new millennium, Engineering and Technology faculty was introduced in JUST, under which department of Petroleum and Mining Engineering (PME) was the third to start. After its inception in 2009, this department rose rapidly as a center of excellence in engineering field. This department offers dynamic field of study and research, which will help to prepare a student to become one of tomorrow's leaders. Our vibrant undergraduate and postgraduate programs provide a broad knowledge of theoretical and empirical aspects of engineering and technology. In its ten years journey, this department has established close cooperation with various Universities and Research Centers in home and abroad. The department has also conducted several national and international seminars, workshops and conferences.It has also recently successfully conducted UGC, HEQEP, & JUST Research Center funded projects. Presently several projects are running which are supported by UGC, HEQEP."
6,te,"The B.Sc. in Textile Engineering program of JUST has been premeditated to accomplish the requirements of our national textile industries for professional manpower as well as for export of trained and competent manpower overseas. The RMG sector has been recognized to have extensively contributed to the GDP of Bangladesh in the figure of foreign earning and has playing an immense role towards women empowerment by creating innumerable career which builds towards the socio-economic improvement at the grass root levels. The Department of Textile Engineering is to be an ingredient of the combined endeavor for enhancing the socio-economic development of the country by offering standard prominence education with a view to preparing trained and skilled textile engineers and by contributing to the great amplification of the textile sector. It has been designed for the well-being of students to acquire modernized proper knowledge, practical experience and understanding the principle and techniques of Textile Engineering. The main aim of the department is to draw the potential talent and aptitude of our youths so that they can meet the challenge of the modern era. We foster the growth of innovative professionals, scientists and engineers who firmly hold the trust and confidence of the community at large."
